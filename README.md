### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my crib

I'm a person who was born in the late '80s of the last century. I do economics and geopolitical analysis with my mom all the time. Also, I spend my free time in my organic garden. I love to read about history, human behavior, physics, biology, and other topics. My favorite art is cinema. I've seen how social dynamics have changed by new technologies. A former senior staff in an E-Banking business, now learning how to code web apps.

### My first PC: `IBM PC2 running windows 3.1`
### My first programming code `Visual Basic`
### My goals: `Find solutions to our current problems`

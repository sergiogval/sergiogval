### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my crib

I'm a person who was born in the late 80's of the last century. I do economics and geopolitical anaisys, spent my free time on my organic garden. I love to read about history, human behavor, physics amoung other topics. My favorite art is cinema. I've seen before my eyes how social dynamics have been disrupted by new technologies. A former Senior staff in a E-Banking business, now learning how to code from the scratch.

### My first PC: `IBM PC2 running windows 3.1`
### My first programming code `Visual Basic`
### My goals: `Find solutions to our current problems`
